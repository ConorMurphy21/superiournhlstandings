# superiournhlstandings

Superiour NHL standings is a website that will show you the standings in whatever point format you desire. Right now the NHL pretends like there is a lot of parity between teams (ie teams are very close in skill). And while this is somewhat the case, it is also somewhat disproportionate to the real parity because teams get points for losing. This website will allow you to compare and contrast competing point systems to see what system actually fits the nhl the best.
